 *  <p>Implementations of this interface are returned by an AuthConfigProvider.</p>
 *  <p>Callers interact with a ClientAuthConfig to obtain ClientAuthContext objects 
 *  suitable for processing a given message exchange at the layer and within the

 *  responsible for instantiating, initializing, and invoking the one or more 
 *  ClientAuthModules encapsulated in the ClientAuthContext.</p>
 *  <p>After having acquired a ClientAuthContext, a caller operates on the context 
 *  to cause it to invoke the encapsulated ClientAuthModules to secure client requests 
 *  and to validate server responses.</p>
